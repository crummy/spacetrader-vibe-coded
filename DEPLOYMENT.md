# Deployment Guide

This project is configured to automatically deploy to GitHub Pages when code is pushed to the `main` branch.

## Automatic Deployment

### Setup Required (One-time)

1. **Enable GitHub Pages** in your repository settings:
   - Go to Settings → Pages
   - Select "GitHub Actions" as the source
   - Save the configuration

2. **Repository Settings** (if needed):
   - Ensure the repository is public, or you have GitHub Pro/Team for private repo Pages
   - Verify that GitHub Actions are enabled for the repository

### How It Works

The deployment process uses GitHub Actions (`.github/workflows/deploy.yml`) and runs automatically on every push to `main`:

1. **Build Process**:
   - Installs Node.js 22 and dependencies
   - Runs TypeScript tests to ensure game logic is working
   - Performs TypeScript type checking (with warnings for any issues)
   - Builds the React UI for production with correct GitHub Pages paths

2. **Deployment Process**:
   - Uploads the built UI assets to GitHub Pages
   - Makes the site available at `https://[username].github.io/spacetrader-ts-4/`

### Current Build Status

✅ **TypeScript Backend**: Fully tested and working  
⚠️  **UI Tests**: Currently disabled in CI due to type compatibility issues  
✅ **Production Build**: Working with Vite handling TypeScript compilation  
✅ **GitHub Pages**: Configured with correct base paths  

### Local Development

To run the project locally:

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm ci

# Start development server
npm run dev:ui

# Run backend tests
npm run test:ts

# Build for production (same as CI)
cd ui && npm run build
```

└── package.json                 # Workspace scripts
```

### Configuration Details

- **Base Path**: The UI is configured to work with GitHub Pages' subdirectory structure (`/spacetrader-ts-4/`)
- **Build Tool**: Vite with React and TypeScript (handles compilation without separate tsc step)
- **Testing**: Node.js native test runner for TS backend (UI tests temporarily disabled)
- **Node Version**: 22+ required (uses experimental TypeScript support)

### Troubleshooting

If deployment fails:

1. Check the Actions tab in GitHub for detailed error logs
2. Ensure backend tests pass locally with `cd ts && npm test`
3. Verify the build works locally with `cd ui && npm run build`
4. Check that GitHub Pages is enabled in repository settings

### Known Issues

- UI component tests have TypeScript compatibility issues that need to be resolved
- These don't affect the production build or game functionality
- The deployment pipeline skips UI tests but still builds successfully

### Manual Deployment

If needed, you can manually trigger a deployment by pushing to `main` or re-running the failed workflow in the GitHub Actions tab.
