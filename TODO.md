## Implementation Notes

### Priority Order
1. **Phase 1**: Essential game data and foundation
2. **Phase 2**: Core gameplay mechanics  
3. **Phase 3**: Rich gameplay experience (encounters and quests)
4. **Phase 4**: Complete game balance and rules
5. **Phase 5**: Comprehensive testing and validation
6. **Phase 6**: Documentation and polish

### Key Architecture Decisions
- **Test-Driven Development**: Write tests FIRST for every function before implementation
- **Functional Programming**: Pure functions only, immutable state transformations
- **TypeScript First**: Strong typing throughout, no `any` types
- **Node.js Native**: Minimal dependencies, use built-in Node.js capabilities
- **Game State Functions**: All game logic as pure functions that transform state
- **Performance**: Optimize for quick game state calculations

### Files to Reference During Implementation
- `palm/Src/spacetrader.h` - All constants and enums
- `palm/Src/DataTypes.h` - Data structure definitions  
- `palm/Src/Global.c` - Static game data arrays
- `palm/Src/Merchant.c` - Main game loop and UI handling
- `palm/ReadMe.txt` - Original development notes and requirements

### Estimated Timeline
- **Phase 1**: 2-3 weeks (foundation and data)
- **Phase 2**: 4-5 weeks (core mechanics)  
- **Phase 3**: 3-4 weeks (events and quests)
- **Phase 4**: 2-3 weeks (balance, rules, and cheats)
- **Phase 5**: 3-4 weeks (comprehensive TDD testing)
- **Phase 6**: 1-2 weeks (documentation)

**Total Estimated Time**: 15-21 weeks for complete port

**Note**: With TDD emphasis, testing time is distributed throughout development, but comprehensive integration testing still requires dedicated phase.
